## Introduction

This C++ program implements a simple School Management System (SMS) that allows users to manage student information. The system provides basic functionalities such as adding new students, displaying all students, searching for a specific student, calculating average scores, and assigning grades based on the percentage obtained.

## Features

1. **Add New Student:**
   - Users can add new students by entering their roll number, name, and age.
   - Duplicate roll numbers are checked to prevent adding the same student multiple times.

2. **Display All Students:**
   - Shows a list of all students currently stored in the system.

3. **Search Student:**
   - Allows users to search for a specific student using their roll number.

4. **Calculate Average Score:**
   - Users can input marks in Computer, Physics, Chemistry, Maths, and English.
   - The total marks, average, and percentage are calculated and displayed.

5. **Assign Grades:**
   - Based on the calculated percentage, the program assigns a grade (A, B, C, D, or E) to the student.

6. **Exit:**
   - Option to exit the School Management System.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Code:**
   - Use a C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later to compile the code.

2. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the compiled program in the terminal or command prompt.

3. **Main Menu:**
   - Choose options from the main menu (1 to 6) to perform various actions.

4. **Follow On-Screen Instructions:**
